# My Portfolio
## Description
- The goal of this Portfolio was to create an aesthetically pleasing and working site so potential employers and/or colleagues could view my work.
- This portfolio is my attempt to showcase my skills and work with simple css and html stylings only.
- Creating this portfolio page has vastly increased my knowledge regarding the differences and possibilities available to me by simply utilizing raw HTML and CSS codes.

        Hi, my name is Jack Ault. I am a Full Stack Web Developer and aspiring Software Engineer. Most recently, I've had the pleasure of developing small applications and am curently working on code to bypass certain security software within various video games. This work in progress is a software designed to "cheat" and "aimbot" with realistic human motion. This has been a goal of mine so that I can help create an anti-cheat that truly works by reverse engineering code and to make it so that my favorite video games are playable again! Whether for work or for leisure, I enjoy exploring ideas that enhance people's lives and broaden the realm of possibilities.
